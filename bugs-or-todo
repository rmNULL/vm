[] Remove deleted window on delete
  - when we delete a customer from customers-window the (deleted) customer
      window maybe open in such close, window should be closed

[] open only a single instance of a window in main-menu

[] add/remove/modify contact fields in customer window

[] don't let multiple windows of same customer open
  ( tbh, don't let multiple windows of anything open unless explicitly
  said so )
