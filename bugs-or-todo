[] Remove deleted window on delete
  - when we delete a customer from customers-window the (deleted) customer
      window maybe open, in such case, close the customer window

[] open only a single instance of a window in main-menu

[] don't let multiple windows of same customer open
  ( tbh, don't let multiple windows of anything open unless explicitly
  said so )

[] customer and supplier have a similar window,
generalize them.

[] ON DELETE CASCADE, is dangerous.
  Perform Logical deletes instead of permanent deletes?

[] (existing) Contact labels doesn't update,
   when new contact labels come
[x] add/remove/modify contact fields in customer window

[x] when a single contact-row(label, num) exists,
  delete the data but keep the default row.
