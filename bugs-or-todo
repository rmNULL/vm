[] Remove deleted window on delete
  - when we delete a customer from customers-window the (deleted) customer
      window maybe open, in such case, close the customer window

[] open only a single instance of a window in main-menu

[] don't let multiple windows of same customer open
  ( tbh, don't let multiple windows of anything open unless explicitly
  said so )

[x] add/remove/modify contact fields in customer window

[] when a single contact-row(label, num) exists,
  delete the data but keep an empty table.
